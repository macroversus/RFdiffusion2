## Configuration Options

This table only has the options shown in the `rf_diffusion/configs/inference/base.yml` and `rf_diffusion/configs/inference/aa.yml` files, as they are the most recommended for use by the developers. 
There are many other configuration (.yml) files in the `configs` directory, the options in them are not guaranteed to work. 
If you would like to create your own configuration file, which can be useful if you routinely use settings that are not the default, see the **Creating Your Own Config File** section, below.
